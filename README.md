# LoXig

This is a [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) interpreter written in Zig.

This is a starting point for Zig solutions to the
["Build your own Interpreter" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview).

This challenge follows the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.
